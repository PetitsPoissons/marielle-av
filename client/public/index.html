    Report this ad 43 19 I have a Meteor/React project, using ES6 modules. I've
    installed materialize-css using npm, but I'm not sure how to actually use
    the Materialize classes in my JSX code. What am I supposed to import from
    materialize-css? Or do I just have to include the CSS in my main index.html
    file? I mostly want it for the grid system, as I'll be using material-ui for
    the actual UI components. reactjs npm materialize material-ui Share Improve

    hopefully you get a good response - I've not had luck with using ES6 imports
    to get materialize-css into my projects, I've had to resort to the
    old-school
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="[insert CDN url]" />
    , which I do not enjoy. – lux Feb 19 '16 at 16:14 Are you using webpack for
    this? Have you come to a solution? I, too have been using the CSS for the
    grid only, but I get by with a link in the head tag; I'm just curious to see
    how others use it. – joepin Apr 24 '18 at 15:41 Add a comment 15 Answers 36
    Since I use CSS Modules, importing materialize css would scope it to that
    particular component. So I did the following Step 1) install materialise npm
    install materialize-css@next Step 2) in index.html
